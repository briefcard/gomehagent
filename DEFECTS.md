# Defect log — what broke, why, and what is still broken

Written 2026-08-11. Read this before changing `kb.py`, `brief.py` or `systems.py`.

Every defect below was found by **running the thing**, not by reading it. Several
were in code that looked correct and had passing tests around it. The patterns in
§1 are the reusable part — the individual bugs matter less than the shapes they
share, because those shapes will recur in the generator, the validator and every
adapter after them.

---

## 1. The patterns — what to watch for

**Silent loss.** A writer returns a status string, the caller ignores it, rows
vanish. Hit us once for real (§2.1) and would have shipped a knowledge base
missing a third of its proof. *Rule: after any bulk write, assert the count
changed. Never trust a return value nobody reads.*

**Unknown collapsed into a value.** The single most common defect here — three
separate instances (§2.5, §2.6, §2.11). Missing data was treated as `False`, or
as `True`, or silently removed. All three are forms of inventing. *Rule: absence
is a third state and must survive all the way to the output.*

**Structural metadata mistaken for content.** Matching searched attribute
*names* as though they were values, so `seated_capacity` "contained" the word
seated (§2.4). *Rule: match against what a thing says, never against how it is
stored.*

**String-matching instead of state-checking.** Whether an answer was accepted
was decided by reading the reply text (§2.3). *Rule: ask the data. `did the gap
close?` is robust; `does the message start with "Format:"` is not.*

**Migration adds columns, not values.** Auto-migration cannot know what a new
column should contain, so every existing row comes back empty and behaviour
silently regresses (§2.9). *Rule: a new column with meaningful defaults needs a
backfill in the same change.*

**Ranking across incomparable scales.** Two scoring modes produced numbers that
were sorted together, so a weak signal outranked a strong one (§2.4, §2.5).
*Rule: when evidence types differ in kind, one must be authoritative and the
other may only break ties.*

## 2. Defects found and fixed

### 2.1 The seed silently dropped three claims
`add_claim` correctly refused claims tagged with situations outside the tenant's
own vocabulary. The return value went nowhere, so the seed reported success while
Baci lost its Four Seasons placement claim and Ironside lost its only claim.
**Fix:** `scripts/seed_kb.py::_claim()` compares row counts and aborts.

### 2.2 A misrouted intake answer wrote garbage into the brand voice
Answering the *tone* question with a pipe-formatted objection stored
`["Corporate","planners","hate","slow","replies"]` as the brand's voice. Nothing
downstream could have detected it.
**Fix:** a pipe in a scalar brand field is treated as a misrouted answer and
refused; tone longer than eight words is refused.

### 2.3 Whether an answer landed was decided by reading the reply text
The intake re-opened a question only if the reply began with `Format:`.
**Fix:** re-check `kb.gaps()` — if the gap is still open the answer was rejected,
whatever the message said.

### 2.4 A 200-seat room was offered for 220 seated guests
Keyword matching searched attribute *names*, so every room with a
`seated_capacity` field "matched" the word seated, and that keyword score was
sorted against genuine capacity comparisons. Glassbox (seats 200) ranked first
for a party of 220.
**Fix:** the searchable blob is name + description + attribute **values**. A
stated requirement is authoritative; keyword relevance only breaks ties.

### 2.5 A keyword match asserted `fits: True`
Relevance was being reported as satisfaction — a generator would have written
"this room fits your party" on the strength of a word appearing in a description.
**Fix:** `fits` is tri-state — `True` checked and satisfied, `False` checked and
not, `None` could not be checked. Keyword matches are always `None`.

### 2.6 Entities lacking the attribute were silently dropped
A space with no seated capacity recorded vanished from results, which implies it
was ruled out when it was never measured.
**Fix:** surfaced as `basis: unknown`, ranked between fits and known-short.

### 2.7 Generic words dragged in the whole catalogue
"colourful" matches every Baci product; "space" matches every Ironside venue. No
hand-written stoplist would generalise to clients we haven't onboarded.
**Fix:** a word appearing in more than 60% of a catalogue is discarded as
uninformative, computed per catalogue from document frequency. No stoplist
anywhere.

### 2.8 Auto-migration silently stripped the agency's offer
`selection` and `next_steps` were added to `KbBrand`. Existing rows came back
empty, `next_step_for` returned nothing, and every agency brief produced a blank
ask. The tests passed; only the rendered output showed it.
**Fix:** `scripts/seed_kb.py::backfill()`. `next_steps` is now also an intake
question so an unconfigured tenant is visibly incomplete.

### 2.9 Gaps that cost nothing were logged as gaps
Recording every unmeasurable entity on every enquiry would bury the ones that
actually lose business.
**Fix:** unknowns are logged only when nothing fit the enquiry.

### 2.10 `n/a` silenced the question but not the noise
Marking an attribute inapplicable removed it from the queue but it still appeared
as an unknown in every future result.
**Fix:** `not_applicable` excludes the entity from that requirement entirely.

### 2.11 A misrouted answer became a banned phrase
The scalar-field guard from §2.2 covered tone and positioning but not
`banned_claims`. A pipe-formatted objection stored as a banned phrase would
silently reject legitimate drafts forever — fail-closed in the wrong direction
is still wrong.
**Fix:** the guard now covers `banned_claims` and `next_steps` too.

### 2.12 Naive vs aware datetimes
SQLite drops the timezone even on `DateTime(timezone=True)`; Postgres keeps it.
Any comparison against `utcnow()` therefore works in production and raises
locally. **Fix:** `db.as_utc()` — always compare through it.

### 2.13 The Knowledge tab showed a third of the knowledge base
The console rendered claims, audiences, objections and entities, and of those only
the headline fields. Never rendered anywhere: the per-tenant **situation
vocabulary** (the controlled list that decides whether a claim is accepted at
all), `next_steps`, `selection`, `approval_policy`, `elevator`, `voice.do_say` /
`never_say`, claim `proof_type` / `verified_at` / `expires_at`, audience
`buying_trigger` / `decision_timeline`, objection `escalate` / `audience_key`,
entity `availability` / `source` / `freshness_days`, and the whole `KbUnknown`
queue.

This is the same shape as §2.8 and it is why §2.8 took so long to see: the
migration emptied `next_steps`, the tests passed, and the only place the damage
showed was a rendered brief — because the console never displayed the field.
A field nobody can read is a field nobody maintains.
**Fix:** `render_kb` shows every column the KB stores, and
`kb.claim_inventory()` / `kb.situation_rows()` were added so it can. Verified by
`scripts/test_kb_ui.py`, which asserts against the rendered HTML per tenant using
the real seed data — if a fact is in the KB and not on the page, it fails.

### 2.14 Non-selectable proof was invisible rather than explained
`claims()` correctly drops pending, retired and expired rows. The console called
it directly, so an account whose proof expired last month looked identical to one
that never had any — the §1 *unknown collapsed into a value* pattern, in the
surface this time rather than the data.
**Fix:** `claim_inventory()` splits every claim by *why* it is or isn't
selectable and the page shows all four states, each labelled. Same for entities:
an `oos` item is now marked rather than listed as if sellable.

### 2.15 Three of the four verification suites had been broken since e9f3460
`kb_seed` moved into `app/` so the web service could reach it, leaving
`scripts/seed_kb.py` a thin CLI wrapper. `test_kb`, `test_selection` and
`test_intake` loaded that file by path and called `m.seed_baci`, which no longer
existed — all three died on `AttributeError` at import. DEFECTS.md meanwhile
claimed all four suites passed, which is worse than the breakage: the document
used to decide whether the system works was asserting something nobody had re-run.
**Fix:** the three scripts import `app.kb_seed` and call `seed_all()`. *Rule: a
refactor that moves a module must be verified by running the suites, not by
reasoning that the callers look fine.*

### 2.16 Smaller ones
- `admin_ui` reported "Runs (8)" when there were more — capped count shown as total.
- FastAPI does not accept `**fields` for query params; read `request.query_params`.
- Published artifact: SVG markers referenced across fragments, and HTML entities
  broke XML parsing. Caught pre-publish by parsing each `<svg>` as XML.
- `TestClient` only fires startup events as a context manager; and
  `sqlite:///:memory:` gives each pooled connection its own empty database.

## 3. Still broken — in priority order

**Recommendation 2 — the readiness bar is a floor, not a standard.** *Not built.*
`completeness()` passes on one or more of each. Ironside reports **ready** on one
claim and one objection; one objection cannot cover what a planner asks. Worse,
a hollow brief still passes: an enquiry that produces no situations, no matched
entity and no offer returns `blocked=False` and would be handed to a generator.

**Recommendation 3 — the ledger and guidance are not wired.** *Not built.*
`systems.start_run`, `finish_run` and `feedback_block` have no callers outside
their test script. Every run stat on the Systems tab is structurally zero, and
every piece of guidance written into a system thread is stored and never read.

**Recommendation 4 — nothing generates.** *Not built.* No generator, no
validator, no send.

**Approval has no tenant, system or run column.** The execution half
(`approvals.py`, `worker.py`, `kernel.py`) has zero tenant awareness. Add the
columns while that table is still empty.

**Idempotency on publish.** A worker restarting mid-publish double-sends.
Must land before anything sends for real.

**No edit or delete on KB rows.** `retire_claim` / `review_claim` now exist for
claims, but audiences, objections and entities remain add-only — a wrong row is
permanent without direct database access.

**Objections are zero on three accounts** (baci, coverings, eien). Human-authored,
cannot be scraped, and half the paid intake.

**Eien's banned claims are my conservative defaults, not Gomeh's.** A supplement
brand with a GLP-1 product. Needs review.

**Free text falls through to an unscoped agent.** No client may be given bot
access until this is fixed.

**The console key travels in every form URL.** Fine while the owner is the only
user; must not be the same credential once clients have logins.

**`kb.SITUATIONS` is still the fallback constant.** Per-tenant vocabularies now
exist as data, but a tenant with none silently inherits agency-B2B language.

## 4. How to verify

```bash
python3 scripts/test_selection.py   # selection + the unknowns loop
python3 scripts/test_systems.py     # registry, contract gate, autonomy ladder
python3 scripts/test_kb.py          # KB writes + guided intake
python3 scripts/test_intake.py      # client intake links, scoping, fail-closed guards
python3 scripts/test_kb_ui.py       # every KB field reaches the Knowledge tab
python3 scripts/test_brief.py --demo
python3 scripts/seed_kb.py --report # what each account still needs
```

All five suites pass as of 2026-08-12. None of them touch the network.

Re-run all five after any change to `kb.py` — §2.15 is what happens when the
claim in this section is trusted instead of re-checked.
